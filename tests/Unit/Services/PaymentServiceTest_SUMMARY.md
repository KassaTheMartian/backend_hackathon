# Payment Service Unit Tests - Summary

## ✅ Test Results: 26/26 PASSING (100%)

Total Assertions: 63
Execution Time: ~3.7 seconds

---

## Test Coverage Overview

### 1️⃣ Payment Listing & Filtering (4 tests)
Tests the ability to retrieve and filter payment records with proper user authorization.

- ✅ **Authenticated User Filtering** - Only show payments for logged-in user
- ✅ **Status Filtering** - Filter by payment status (pending/completed/failed/refunded)
- ✅ **Payment Method Filtering** - Filter by payment method (vnpay)
- ✅ **Guest Access** - List payments without user authentication

**Key Implementation:**
```php
$filters = [
    'per_page' => 15,
    'user_id' => $request->user()?->id,
    'status' => $request->query('status'),
    'payment_method' => $request->query('payment_method'),
];
return $this->paymentRepository->getWithFilters($filters);
```

### 2️⃣ VNPay Payment Creation (3 tests)
Tests the creation of VNPay payment requests with proper URL generation and signature.

- ✅ **Successful Payment Creation** - Create payment with valid VNPay URL
- ✅ **Booking Validation** - Throw exception when booking not found
- ✅ **Guest Payment Support** - Store guest email and phone in metadata

**VNPay URL Generated:**
```
https://sandbox.vnpayment.vn/paymentv2/vpcpay.html?
  vnp_Version=2.1.0&
  vnp_Command=pay&
  vnp_TmnCode=TEST_TMN&
  vnp_Amount=50000000&  // Amount * 100
  vnp_TxnRef=BK123_20231029120000&
  vnp_SecureHash=<HMAC-SHA512>
```

---

### 3️⃣ VNPay Return URL Processing (7 tests)
Tests payment confirmation when user returns from VNPay payment page.

- ✅ **Successful Payment** - Update payment & booking status to completed/paid
- ✅ **Signature Verification** - Validate HMAC-SHA512 secure hash
- ✅ **Transaction Not Found** - Handle missing transaction ID
- ✅ **Merchant Validation** - Verify TMN code matches configuration
- ✅ **Amount Validation** - Verify amount matches payment record
- ✅ **Idempotency** - Prevent duplicate processing of completed payments
- ✅ **Failed Payment** - Update status to failed when response code != '00'

**Security Checks:**
1. Verify `vnp_SecureHash` matches computed hash
2. Verify `vnp_TmnCode` matches config
3. Verify `vnp_Amount` matches payment amount * 100
4. Check idempotency (already completed/refunded)

---

### 4️⃣ VNPay IPN Webhook Handling (7 tests)
Tests instant payment notification webhook from VNPay servers.

- ✅ **Successful Confirmation** - Return RspCode 00 for valid IPN
- ✅ **Invalid Checksum** - Return RspCode 97 for signature mismatch
- ✅ **Order Not Found** - Return RspCode 01 when transaction missing
- ✅ **Invalid Merchant** - Return RspCode 03 for wrong TMN code
- ✅ **Invalid Amount** - Return RspCode 04 for amount mismatch
- ✅ **Idempotency** - Return RspCode 00 for already processed payments
- ✅ **Failed Payment** - Update status to failed when response code != '00'

**IPN Response Codes:**
- `00` - Success
- `01` - Order not found
- `03` - Invalid merchant
- `04` - Invalid amount
- `97` - Invalid checksum

---

### 5️⃣ VNPay Refund Operations (2 tests)
Tests payment refund functionality (simulated for hackathon scope).

- ✅ **Successful Refund** - Update payment status to refunded
- ✅ **Transaction Not Found** - Throw exception when transaction missing

**Note:** Refund is simulated locally without actual VNPay API call.

---

### 6️⃣ VNPay Query Operations (3 tests)
Tests payment status query functionality.

- ✅ **Completed Payment Query** - Return ResponseCode 00, TransactionStatus 00
- ✅ **Pending Payment Query** - Return ResponseCode 02, TransactionStatus 01
- ✅ **Transaction Not Found** - Throw exception when transaction missing

**Response Structure:**
```php
[
    'success' => true,
    'payment' => $payment,
    'gateway_response' => [
        'vnp_ResponseCode' => '00',  // 00 = success, 02 = pending/failed
        'vnp_TransactionStatus' => '00',  // 00 = completed, 01 = pending
    ]
]
```

## Key Features Tested

### 🔐 Security
- HMAC-SHA512 signature generation and verification
- Merchant code validation
- Amount verification to prevent tampering
- Idempotency checks to prevent duplicate processing

### 💳 Payment Flow
1. **Create Payment** → Generate VNPay URL with signature
2. **User Pays** → Redirect to VNPay payment page
3. **Return URL** → User returns, payment status updated
4. **IPN Webhook** → VNPay confirms payment server-to-server
5. **Query/Refund** → Check status or refund payment

### 🎯 Business Logic
- User-specific payment filtering
- Booking status updates on successful payment
- Guest payment support with metadata
- Payment status lifecycle (pending → completed/failed → refunded)

### 🏗️ Architecture
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- Dependency injection for testability
- Clean separation of concerns

---

## Test Execution

```bash
# Run payment service tests only
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/Services/PaymentServiceTest.php --testdox

# Run with coverage
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/Services/PaymentServiceTest.php --coverage-html coverage/

# Run specific test
vendor/bin/phpunit --filter=test_vnpay_create_successfully_creates_payment
```

---

## Mocking Strategy

### Repositories Mocked
```php
$this->paymentRepository = Mockery::mock(PaymentRepositoryInterface::class);
$this->bookingRepository = Mockery::mock(BookingRepositoryInterface::class);
```

### Models Mocked with makePartial()
```php
$payment = Mockery::mock(Payment::class)->makePartial();
$payment->id = 1;
$payment->amount = 500000;
```

**Why `makePartial()`?**
- Allows setting properties directly
- Prevents `setAttribute()` Mockery errors
- Maintains Eloquent model behavior when needed

### Config Mocking
```php
Config::set('vnpay.tmn_code', 'TEST_TMN');
Config::set('vnpay.hash_secret', 'TEST_SECRET_KEY');
```

---

## VNPay Integration Details

### Hash Generation (HMAC-SHA512)
```php
protected function vnpHash(array $params): string
{
    ksort($params);  // Sort by key
    $pairs = [];
    foreach ($params as $key => $value) {
        $pairs[] = $key . '=' . rawurlencode((string)$value);
    }
    $data = implode('&', $pairs);
    return hash_hmac('sha512', $data, config('vnpay.hash_secret'));
}
```

### Transaction Reference Format
```php
$txnRef = 'BK' . $booking->id . '_' . now()->format('YmdHis');
// Example: BK123_20231029120000
```

### Amount Conversion
```php
'vnp_Amount' => $amount * 100  // VNPay uses smallest currency unit (1 VND = 100)
```

---

## Test Patterns Used

### 1. Arrange-Act-Assert
```php
// Arrange
$payment = Mockery::mock(Payment::class)->makePartial();
$this->paymentRepository->shouldReceive('find')->andReturn($payment);

// Act
$result = $this->paymentService->vnpayQuery('BK123_20231029120000');

// Assert
$this->assertTrue($result['success']);
```

### 2. Exception Testing
```php
$this->expectException(ModelNotFoundException::class);
$this->paymentService->vnpayCreate(999, null, 'vi', null, null);
```

### 3. Callback Assertions
```php
$this->paymentRepository
    ->shouldReceive('create')
    ->once()
    ->andReturnUsing(function ($data) use ($payment) {
        $this->assertEquals('vnpay', $data['payment_method']);
        $this->assertEquals('pending', $data['status']);
        return $payment;
    });
```

### 4. Helper Method for Hash Generation
```php
private function generateVnpHash(array $params): string
{
    unset($params['vnp_SecureHash'], $params['vnp_SecureHashType']);
    ksort($params);
    // ... hash generation logic
}
```

---

## Configuration Required

### VNPay Settings (config/vnpay.php)
```php
return [
    'url' => env('VNPAY_URL', 'https://sandbox.vnpayment.vn/paymentv2/vpcpay.html'),
    'tmn_code' => env('VNPAY_TMN_CODE'),
    'hash_secret' => env('VNPAY_HASH_SECRET'),
    'return_url' => env('VNPAY_RETURN_URL'),
];
```

### Environment Variables
```env
VNPAY_URL=https://sandbox.vnpayment.vn/paymentv2/vpcpay.html
VNPAY_TMN_CODE=your_merchant_code
VNPAY_HASH_SECRET=your_secret_key
VNPAY_RETURN_URL=http://localhost/payment/return
```

---

## Integration with Booking System

### On Successful Payment
```php
if ($success) {
    $booking->update([
        'payment_status' => 'paid',
        'status' => 'confirmed',
    ]);
}
```

### Payment Status Lifecycle
```
pending → completed (payment successful)
        → failed (payment failed)
        → refunded (refund requested)
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. Add actual VNPay API integration tests (sandbox)
2. Test concurrent payment processing
3. Test payment timeout scenarios
4. Add tests for partial refunds
5. Test currency conversion if multi-currency support added

### Monitoring & Alerts
- Log all IPN responses
- Alert on repeated signature failures
- Track payment success rate
- Monitor payment processing time
